Changes in basifoR 0.4.1

- Fixed missing Rd \link{} targets by providing package anchors for:  
  - `readNFI.Rd`: added links for `read.dbf`, `RODBC`, and `mdb.get`.  
  - `urlToTemp.Rd`: ensured proper linking for `timeout`.  



Changes in basifoR 0.4

- `urlToTemp`: The API for the SNFI has changed.  
  The old domain `'www.mapama.gob.es'` has been replaced with `'www.miteco.gob.es'`.  
- Internet resources now fail gracefully, providing an informative message  
  if a resource is unavailable or has changed. This prevents check warnings  
  or errors.
